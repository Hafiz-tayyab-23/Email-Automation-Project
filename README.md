# ðŸ“§ Email Extractor from Text Files

## Overview

This Python script automates a small but common repetitive task â€” **extracting all email addresses** from a `.txt` file and saving them into a separate file.
It uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `re` (regular expressions) module for pattern matching and standard file handling for reading and writing data.

---

## Features

* Scans any `.txt` file for **valid-looking email addresses**.
* Automatically removes **duplicates**.
* Sorts emails alphabetically before saving.
* Saves the clean list of emails into a specified output file.
* Simple and lightweight â€” no external libraries required.

---

## How It Works

1. Prompts the user for:

   * The **input file path** (the `.txt` file to scan).
   * The **output file name** (where extracted emails will be stored).
2. Reads the input file content.
3. Uses a regular expression to **find all email addresses** in the text.
4. Removes duplicates and sorts them alphabetically.
5. Writes the final list to the output file.
6. Displays the number of unique email addresses found.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python email_extractor.py
Enter the path to the .txt file to scan for emails: newsletter_with_300+_emails.txt
Enter the filename to save found email addresses: extracted_emails.txt
Found 312 unique email addresses. Saved to extracted_emails.txt.
```

## Regex Pattern Used

```python
r"[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+"
```

* `[\w\.-]+` â†’ Matches one or more **letters, digits, underscores, dots, or hyphens**.
* `@` â†’ Matches the literal **@** symbol.
* `[\w\.-]+` â†’ Matches the **domain** part of the email.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external dependencies
